                Ganesh Tekdi Temple also known as "Takdicha Ganapati" means Ganpati of hills. Situated atop a hill on Station Road, 
                this temple is about 250 years old and has immense religious significance for Hinduism. The construction of the temple 
                started in 1978 and was completed in 1984. Late Ganpatrao Joshi and other devotees enthusiastically participated in the 
                construction of Shri Ganesh Tekdi Temple. The presiding deity of the temple is Lord Ganesha and it is believed that the 
                idol of the Lord is Swayambhu, who originated from the land itself.
