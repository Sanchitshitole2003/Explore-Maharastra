        Pratapgad is a mountain fort located in Satara district, in the Western Indian state of Maharashtra.The fort is situated 24 kilometres from the Mahabaleshwar hill station. The fort is now a popular tourist destination.

</br>

    
        The fort's historical significance is due to the Battle of Pratapgad, which took place here on 10 November 1659, between Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and Bijapur Sultanate general Afzal Khan. Chatrapati Shivaji's killing of Afzal Khan was followed by decisive Maratha victory over the Bijapur army.

        The fort is divided into two parts, the lower fort, and the upper fort. The upper fort was built upon the crest of the hill. It is roughly square, 180 m long on each side. The upper fort comprises several buildings, including a Mahadev Temple. The lower fort situated at the southeast end of the fort is defended by tall towers and strongholds which are 10-12 m high. The lower fort is around 320 m long and 110 m wide. It houses Bhavani Temple on the eastern side. It is believed that Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaja was blessed with a shining sword at this temple. A 17 feet tall bronze figure of Shivaji was erected and unveiled by Jawaharlal Nehru, on 30th November 1957 to commemorate and pay homage to Shivaji Maharaj.
