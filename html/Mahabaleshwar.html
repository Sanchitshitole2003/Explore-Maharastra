        Present-day Mahabaleshwar has come into existence in the year 1829-30 when it became the summer capital of the Bombay presidency during the British Raj. Earlier, it was known as Malcolm Peth and the first historical mention of Mahabaleshwar dates back to 1215 CE when the King Singhan of Devgiri visited Old Mahabaleshwar. He built a small temple and water tank at the source of the river Krishna. In the 16th century, the Maratha family of Chandarao ruled over the city. Later, in the 17th century, Jaoli and Mahabaleshwar were taken over by Shivaji Maharaj, who constructed the Pratapgarh Fort in 1656 CE. The city also witnessed the imprints of the British, who included the destination in the territory of the Raja of Satara in 1819.

        Mahabaleshwar is the source of the Krishna River that flows across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The legendary source of the river is a spout from the mouth of a statue of a cow in Panch Ganga Temple in Old Mahabaleshwar. Four other rivers also flow from here, before they merge into the Krishna; these are Koyana, Venna (Veni), Savitri, and Gayatri.
