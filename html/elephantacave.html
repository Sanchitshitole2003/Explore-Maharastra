          The 'City of Caves', on an island in the Sea of Oman close to Bombay, contains a collection of rock art linked
          to the cult of Shiva. Here, Indian art has found one of its most perfect expressions, particularly the huge
          high reliefs in the main cave.

          The Elephanta Caves contain rock-cut stone sculptures, mostly in high relief, that show syncretism of Hindu
          and Buddhist ideas and iconography. The caves are hewn from solid basalt rock. Except for a few
          exceptions, much of the artwork is defaced and damaged. The main temple's orientation as well as the
          relative location of other temples are placed in a mandala pattern.The carvings narrate Hindu mythologies,
          with the large monolithic 5.45 metres Trimurti Sadashiva (three-faced Shiva), Nataraja (Lord of
          dance) and Yogishvara (Lord of Yoga) being the most celebrated.<br />
